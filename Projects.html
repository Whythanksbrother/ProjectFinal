                <img class="st" src="images/firstwebsite.png" alt="The first website I coded">
                <p>This was the very first website I built. It was definitly very basic but I learned how to make my very own website and how to add certain elements to it</p>
                <img class="st" src="images/3rdwebsite.png" alt="Third website I coded">
                <p>This was my 3rd project and one of my favorites. We took control of the website with some more advanced CSS like making and added things like shading to images and tables with links</p>

                <p>This is the 4th website we built. We learned how to add forms and buttons like a contact me page!</p>
